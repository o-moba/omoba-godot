# OMOBA - Open Multiplayer Online Battle Arena

## Introduction

Welcome to the early prototype of OMOBA, an Open Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game developed using the Godot Engine. This project serves as a preliminary platform to explore basic functionalities and implement core business logic essential for understanding the programming requirements and methodologies needed to build the game.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this prototype is to lay down the foundational business logic and gameplay mechanics. By developing this initial version, we aim to identify and resolve potential technical challenges and establish a robust framework for future development.

## Future Plans

While the current prototype is developed in Godot, there are plans to migrate and further enhance the game using the Bevy engine. This decision will be based on the insights gained during this early phase, ensuring that the transition supports the enhancement of game performance and scalability.

## Current Features

- Basic Gameplay Mechanics: Basic player movements and defender spawning.

## TODO:
- Implement defender attacks against each other.
- Implement towers.
- Blockchain authorisation via login/password smart contract.
- Hotload glb/gltf 3d models.
- Multiplayer Support: Basic networking setup to support multiplayer gameplay.
- Prototype Levels: Early stage maps to test gameplay dynamics and user interaction.
- ...

## Technologies Used

- Godot Engine: A powerful and open-source game engine that is currently used to build the initial prototype.
- (Future) Bevy Engine: Planned for later stages to leverage its cutting-edge features for a more immersive gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Godot installed on your machine. After cloning this repository:

1. Open Godot.
2. Import the project.
3. Run the project to start the game.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers interested in multiplayer game development. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the game's architecture, your help would be greatly appreciated.
